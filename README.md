A comparison of test frameworks in javascript

In this repo, I am going to experiment with several test frameworks against a simple math.js library and make a comparison of these.
For simplicity, I'm not going to use babel transpilation or bundling. 

This demo is using [ES6 modules directly in the browser](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/). You will need [a browser with module support](https://caniuse.com/#search=modules).

## running the example

Type `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to start a http server at your localhost, port 8080.
Or just browse to https://terabaud.github.io/javascript-tests/.
